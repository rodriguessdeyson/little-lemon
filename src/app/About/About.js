					<h2>A Journey Through Generations</h2>
					<p>
						In the heart of our bustling city, nestled among cobblestone streets and sun-kissed courtyards,
						lies Little Lemon ‚Äì more than just a restaurant.
						We are a family, bound by a shared love for good food and a rich heritage that stretches back to 1957.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our story begins with Nonno Giovanni, the patriarch of our clan.
						A man with calloused hands and a heart as warm as the Mediterranean sun, he set foot on American soil with a dream.
						Armed with cherished recipes passed down through generations, he opened the doors of Little Lemon, a humble eatery that would soon become a culinary haven.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nonno Giovanni's vision was simple: infuse the vibrant flavors of his homeland into every dish.
						He believed in the magic of reinvention, the alchemy that transforms humble ingredients into extraordinary feasts.
						And so, he took those time-honored recipes ‚Äì the ones that graced our family tables for years ‚Äì and breathed new life into them.
